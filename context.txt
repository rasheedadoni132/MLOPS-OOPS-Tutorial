1. Class and Object (Example)
2. Class has data/attributes and func/method in it.
    > Code walkthrough
    > attribute get called itself, methods as called manually.
3. Why Python is called objext oreinted program?
4. Advanatges of OOPS:
    > You can create own data type
    > code reusability'
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
5. End to end project (chatbook)
    > Function VS methods
    > magic method and dunder method
    > Self
    > You can create attribute outside Class
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method
6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code Example
    > Why Inheritance is needed? (code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
    > what gets inherited? - constructor, non private attributes, non private methods
    > constructor overloading and method overloading
    > Super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)
    > Types of Inheritance: 1. Single Ingeritance, 2. Multilevel, 3. Heirarchical, 4. Multiple <diamond problem>, 5. Hybrid
